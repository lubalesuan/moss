<p>Q: Who am I?</p>

<p>A: This question, among “What is the meaning of life? What happens to me after I die? “, has caused waves of existential crisis for many generations, is dreaded and avoided by many, and understandably so.  </p>

<p>If I do not know who I am, how can I live purposefully? Without knowing what I want, how can I decide my next actions? Am I just being carried away by the current of circumstances? Am I in control of what happens to me, and of what I am doing? </p>

<!-- 
<p> Determinism defines me as a composite of previous experience, as a product of genetics, culture, history, environment, etc. All future actions are predetermined as a result of varying conditions described above. Any other creature, given the exact same setting of those conditions would essentially be as much me as I am. </p>

<p> If the "Who am I" question appeared from a thinking process that fired neurons in my brain, am I just my brain? Am I just a pink knotted blob transported by a walking bag of bones and meat?</p>
 -->
<p> Suppose, I am just trying to define the boundaries of what that "I" could be. The most obvious boundary would be my physical body. When I cut my hair, are the hairs on the floor also me? Then I have lost and have replaced "myself" multiple times throughout my lifetime (ship of Theseus). Let's agree, that me does not end  with my physical container.</p>

<p>Are my creations also me? When I write an essay, is that essay also "me"? Or is it just a piece of paper with ink squizzed on it? If so, then things are a mere physical representation, and I must only be just an elongated blob transportated on walking sticks.</p>

<p>Maybe the essay I have written is a reflection of me. In other words, it took on some of my properties, it is me, in some sense, but by itself it is a paper. Well, then how much of paper it is and how much of me it contains? If I tear it into little pieces, how much paperness will be left in it? Avoiding the semantic hell, I will revert back to boundaries of oneself.<!-- If I tear it in little pieces, or if I glue it to a piece of clay, or if I paint it, is it still going to be a paper? Running this experiment will end us in semantic hell, so let me revert back to the boundaries of "me". --></p>

<p> Stemming from the above, any thing that I have interacted with is carrying some imprint of mine. It is not only hard, but impossible to find out where "I" end, and where "other" things begin. We can adhere to our definitions of things to indicate a boundary between "me", "you", "tree", "fluid", "anger". However, we must also recognize that those definitions are not precise, as they can't tag the transformation of those things. When do you stop calling a tree a tree? When you chop it down? When you chop and mash it in little pieces to produce paper? Is paper a tree? Is a branch a tree? All of those have been transformations of tree we started with, however, we doubt to call them a "tree" in all cases. (Noah Chomsky, "Is the man who is tall happy?")</p>

<p>If it is impossible to define the boundaries of "me" and "other" things, let's pretend we have none.  </p>
