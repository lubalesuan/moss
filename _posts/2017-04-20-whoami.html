<p>Q: Who am I?</p>

<p>A: This question, among “What is the meaning of life? What happens to me after I die? “, has caused waves of existential crisis for many generations, is dreaded and avoided by many, and understandably so.  </p>

<p>If I do not know who I am, how can I live purposefully? Without knowing what I want, how can I decide my next actions? Am I just being carried away by the current of circumstances? Am I in control of what happens to me, and of what I am doing? </p>

<hr>

<p> Determinism defines me as a composite of previous experience, as a product of genetics, culture, history, environment, etc. All future actions are predetermined as a result of varying conditions described above. Any other creature, given the exact same setting of those conditions would essentially be as much me as I am. </p>

<p> If the "Who am I" question appeared from a thinking process that fired neurons in my brain, am I just my brain? Am I just a pink knotted blob transported by a walking bag of bones and meat?</p>

<p> Suppose, I am just trying to define the boundaries of what that "I" could be. The most obvious boundary would be my physical body. When I write an essay, is that essay also "me"? Or is it just a piece of paper with ink squizzed on it? If so, then I am just the pink blob on two walking sticks.</p>

<p>Maybe, it is a reflection of me, it took some of my properties, but by itself, it's a paper. Well, then what is a paper? If I tear it in little pieces, or if I glue it to a piece of clay, if I paint it, is it still going to be a paper? Running this experiment will end us in semantic hell, so let me revert back to the boundaries of "me".</p>
