<p>Q: Who am I?</p>

<p>A: This question, among “What is the meaning of life? What happens to me when I die? “, has caused waves of existential crisis for many generations, is dreaded and avoided by many, and understandably so.  </p>

<p>If I do not know who I am, how can I live purposefully? Without knowing what I want, how can I decide my next actions? Am I just being carried away by the current of circumstances? Am I in control of what happens to me, and of what I am doing? </p>

<hr>

<p>Determinism defined me as a composite of experience that I have accumulated, that is every next experience is predetermined by a result of previous experience. I am a product of genetics, culture, history, environment, and some fluctuating conditions, and all my actions are determined by the variying setting of conditions.</p>
