<p>-Ken Robinson's Ted Talk: "Do Schools Kill Creativity?"</p>

<h4>Essential</h4>
<p>My procrastination reached obscene level of intellectual exercise and of complete neglect for schoolwork. But back to the essential: the above 3 books and a video prompted me to understand myself more fully, and to play some curious thought experiments. Here they are:</p>
<p>In his TED talk as well as his book Sir Ken Robinson brings attention to the problem of education. That is, the system is designed to train students to become workers in specific industry and develops a certain kind of human intelligence and skill: mathematical, analytical, while ignoring fostering of others. It has also evolved to suppress any stems of creativity: standardized testing requires only one correct answer and denounces making mistakes or looking for alternative paths to answer questions.</p>
<p>The current education system (and possibly demands of job market and economy) kill talent at its root. Most children tend to be creative, imaginative, until they learn in school and from society that there is no place for their talent, unless it brings monetary profit. He used examples of Paul McCarthney, Elvis Presley, Matt Groening (creator of "The Simpsons" to show how schools were not only unapt to breed their talent, not only didn't recognize it, but also discouraged them from pursuing their talents further on (Elvis Presleyy got rejected from a glee club, because according to them "he would ruin the sound"). All of those great achievers had to abandon school to dedicate themselves to their passion, or pursue them in their afte school time. Question is: why haven't we accomodated talent, haven't we given place for people to reach their fullest potential in schools, a place where most of us spend ~1/4 of our lives? The glory of human achievement has been attained through some personas' incredible hard work, persistence, and resistance to public dissuasion and disbelief. His argument is that to pursue a future, where every person can fulffill themselves through doing what they most love, and thus, is leading a happy, meaningful life, we have to first change our attitude towards schooling.</p>
