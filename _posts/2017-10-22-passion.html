<h4>Essential</h4>
<p>My procrastination reached obscene level of intellectual exercise and of complete neglect for schoolwork. But back to the essential: the above 3 books and a video prompted me to understand myself more fully, and to play some curious thought experiments. Here they are:</p>
<p>In his TED talk as well as his book Sir Ken Robinson brings attention to the problem of education. That is, the system is designed to train students to become workers in specific industry and develops a certain kind of human intelligence and skill: mathematical, analytical, while ignoring fostering of others. It has evolved to suppress any stems of creativity: standardized testing requires only one correct answer and denounces making mistakes or looking for alternative paths to answer questions. He argues that creativity must be supported through school, since it can give us tools to adapt to the quickly evolving world and to know how to implement our skill to a changed reality.</p>
<p>The current education system (and possibly demands of job market and economy) kills talent at its root. Most children tend to be creative, imaginative, until they learn in school and from society that there is no place for their talent, unless it brings monetary profit. He used Paul McCarthney, Elvis Presley, Matt Groening (creator of "The Simpsons") to examplify how schools were not only unapt to breed their talent, not only didn't recognize it, but also discouraged them from pursuing their talents further on (Elvis Presleyy got rejected from a glee club, because according to them "he would ruin the sound"). All of those great achievers had to pursue their passions in afterschool time or had to give up school in general. Question is: why haven't we accomodated talent, haven't we given place for people to reach their fullest potential in schools? What is the purpose of school if not to prepare children for their future lives? Currently existing school system resists evolution of talent, creativity, questioning and daring, and those have been main contributors to the glorious achievements of humanity. Sir Robinson says that to found a future in which people are encouraged to follow and work on what they love, and thus achieve the best of human potential and thus, give humanity meaningful, happy lives, we have to reconsider schooling and our attitude to creativity.</p>
<p>"Manna" is offering solutions to the problem above. "Manna" describes antiutopian world in which a bunch of capitalists fully automatized all industries pushing out human workers from jobs and bringing them to the brink of poverty. The alternative to such a grim perspective was "Australian project", utopian world in which through full automatization of labor, full recyclability of resources, humans freed themselves from bane of doing meaningless jobs, being concerned about money, and from chains of greed and lies (you really have to read it). All citizens of "Australian Project" had some amount of credits/week that couldn't be spent entirely no matter how hard you would try, thus eliminating poverty, and greed. Since robots provided all meals, housing, and any other things that we normally look to secure, humans could pursue anything they wanted in their free time.</p>
<p>"Australian Project" has seen unlimited development in science, technology, medicine, art, and in any (un)imaginable areas, unrestrained by funding, or any government law. The task of each person was to understand what is it that they want to do, and just do it.</p>
<p>The takeaway from these 2 books is that humanity could live happily, harmoniously, while revealing the greatest of our skill, talent, intelligence, and character. It is not known how to achieve that state, but worth pondering about. The main obstacles are necessity to pursue financial stability, necessity to secure one's life, fear, our apprehension of uncommon, unstandard, discouragement of creativity, innovation, while on the other hand, greed, extensive power directed at increasing one's wealth, selfishness.</p>
<p>Quite certainly, we won't be able to eradicate those too soon, however, through some reflection, I have found some possible solutions. To let people pursue what they want you have to reroute their lives by giving them means to survive (basic income, universal welfare), but above all means to pursue their passions, their happiness (grants, awards, funding, microfinance). Why would such approach work? It is not enough to just save a person from dying from hunger, and homelessness, but it is vital to invest into their perspectives. I have heard about programs that provide food and housing for homeless people in San Fransisco. However, many homeless people are elderly people of non working age, and even if they do get those basic necessities covered, they have no opportunity to find a job, nor means to do anything else they would like, thus many revert to heavy drug abuse as a better alternative. Funding both basic necessities, and people's passions is sure, an expensive endeavor, but here are two things I found curious:</p>
<p>First, we have not ever figured out what people truly want. We never had an opportunity to find the answer. Throughout the history of humanity, each generation had to work in order to provide themselves with food and shelter at the very least. Financing people to pursue their happiness would be a great psychological experiment to see the true nature of people.</p>
<p>Similarly to "Manna" we might see that once their lives are paid for, people would unravel their natural talents and create something wonderful. Maybe, to be a Paul McCartney all it takes is free time :).</p>
