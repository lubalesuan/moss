<p>The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is
that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can’t escape its
predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind.
Numbers exist only in the mind. I don’t get upset when scientists
say that ghosts exist in the mind. It’s that only that gets me. Science
is only in your mind too, it’s just that that doesn’t make it bad. Or
ghosts either.”
They are just looking at me so I continue: “Laws of nature are
human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of mathematics are also
human inventions, like ghosts. The whole blessed thing is a human
invention, including the idea that it isn’t a human invention. The
world has no existence whatsoever outside the human imagination.
It’s all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the
whole blessed world we live in. It’s run by ghosts. We see what we
see because these ghosts show it to us, ghosts of Moses and Christ
and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson
and Lincoln, on and on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good
ghost. One of the best. Your common sense is nothing more than
the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghosts from the past.
Ghosts and more ghosts. Ghosts trying to find their place among
the living.</p>
