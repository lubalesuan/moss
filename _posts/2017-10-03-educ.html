<p>Do we need education? Is the purpose of education to help us learn the intricate rules of society and succeed in it in terms of wealth, health and wellbeing of our family (for survival of our genes maybe)?</p>

<p> The paradigm of education system currently is dictated by the needs of job market, government, and other systems of power. They invest into promoting STEM, especially technology, not purely out of compassion and benevolence, but to train future generation of workforce. If you are a child at school knowing that some company has paid for your equipment, facilities, teachers, as well as strengthened your tech and STEM curriculum, it is a likely scenario that you will pursue a corporate career out of gratitude, due to targeted promotion of it throughout school, and for financial stability. </p>

<p>We have to realize what an ultimate role education holds for humanity. We spend ~ half of our lives learning in schools, thus it is for our benefit to spend that time wisely. To know in which ways education should be changed is to answer the question: who do we want to become in the future?</p>

<p> If exploitation and constant pursuit of wealth is our goal, then current education system is quite successful at satisfying such goals. However, if we are looking to raise thinking, questioning, curious, and compassionate individuals, we have to give more room for those qualities to breed. That involves presenting school material not as a dogma, ultimate truth, but as information to reflect upon, to question. It involves stopping segmenting knowledge into disjoint parts (school topics division) that prevent most people to see a fuller picture of the world, prevents them from connecting events, causes, and phenomenons together. It involves giving freedom of exploration and play through which children are shown to learn most effectively since they are sincerely interested in the activity. Throughout history we have traced that the greatest minds were able to create, invent, reform, and revolutionize by courage of questioning what is taken for granted, by linking knowledge from one field to another, by exploring and being open to consider many possible explanations. Ignorance or uneducatedness doesn't purely rely on predisposed conditions (genes, family, culture), but rather, on our nurturing of our capabilities. </p>

<p>Will we ever want to pursue our passion, curisotiy, interest, desire to change, create, undermine in our learning? Will we always stupify our natural instincts to do the above in order to provide machines of power with desired type of people (obedient workers, citizens)? Will we ever pursue exploration, research, knowledge for our happiness, for harmony, for our own good, or those will always be funded by, and thus, shaped by those in power?  </p>
