<p>Do we need education? Is the purpose of education to help us learn the intricate rules of society and succeed in it in terms of wealth, health and wellbeing of our offsprings and relatives (for survival of our genes maybe)?</p>

<p> The paradigm of education system currently is dictated by the needs of job market, government, and other systems of power. They invest into promoting STEM, especially technology, not purely out of compassion and benevolence, but to train future generation of corporate workforce and income provider for government. If you are a child at school aware that some company has paid for your equipment, facilities, your teachers, as well as strengthened your tech and STEM curriculum, it is a likely scenario that you will pursue a tech career out of gratitude, marketing throughout duration of your school, and pursuits of financial stability. </p>

<p>We have to realize what an ultimate role education holds for humanity. We spend ~ half of our lives learning in schools, thus it is for our benefit to spend that time wisely. To know in which ways education should be changed is to answer the question: who do we want to be in the future?</p>

<p> If exploitation and constant pursuit of wealth is our goal, then we succeed as preparing children for such a system. However, if we are looking to reach the greatest potential of humanity by raising thinking, questioning, curious, and compassionate individuals, we have to give more room for those qualities to breed. Tha involves presenting school material not as a dogma, ultimate truth, but an information to reflect upon, to question. It involves stopping segmenting knowledge into disjoint parts that prevent most people to see a fuller, scalable picture of the world, prevents them from connecting events, causes, and phenomenons together. Throughout history we have traced that those greatest were able to create, invent, reform, and revolutionize by courage of questioning what is taken for granted, by linking knowledge from one field to another, by exploring and being open to consider any theorem. Ignorance or uneducatedness doesn't purely rely on predisposed conditions (genes, family, culture), but rather, on our nurturing of our capabilities. </p>

<p>Will we ever want to pursue our passion, curisotiy, interest, desire to change, create, undermine in our learning? Will we always stupify our natural instincts to do the above in order to provide machines of power with the type of people they desire (obedient workers, citizens)? Will we ever pursue exploration, research, knowledge for our happiness, for our harmony, for our own good, or those will always be funded by, and thus, shaped by funding?  </p>
